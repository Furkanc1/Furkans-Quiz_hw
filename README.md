# Furkans-Word-Puzzle_hw
Week 4's Homework assignment, Creating a word puzzle game using javascript and implementing WEB-API's
## What was done so far as of 3rd Comit ##
- We created and designed the HTML elements
- This includes linking Bootstrap, Creating Parent (body) with elements inside of it including (div>, article>, h1>, ul>, li>) as well as Parent (footer) which included elements such as (div>, ul>, and h3>)
- We created the style.css sheet and applied elements onto it to make the webpage more pleasing to the eye
(these elements were defined in the html and style.css sheet using #ID and .Class Tags)
-Website Layout is complete, moving forward all that needs to be completed is the JavaScript Elements to play the game, as well as whatever is necessary Web-API wise (TUTORING SESSION SOON) 
- We have also created a "Leaderboard Box" where the stats will be stored as to who is playing and their score in real time (hopefully)
