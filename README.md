# Furkans-Word-Puzzle_hw
Week 4's Homework assignment, Creating a word puzzle game using javascript and implementing WEB-API's
## What was done so far as of 3rd Comit ##
- We created and designed the HTML elements
- This includes linking Bootstrap, Creating Parent (body) with elements inside of it including (div>, article>, h1>, ul>, li>) as well as Parent (footer) which included elements such as (div>, ul>, and h3>)
- We created the style.css sheet and applied elements onto it to make the webpage more pleasing to the eye
(these elements were defined in the html and style.css sheet using #ID and .Class Tags)
-Website Layout is complete, moving forward all that needs to be completed is the JavaScript Elements to play the game, as well as whatever is necessary Web-API wise (TUTORING SESSION SOON) 
- We have also created a "Leaderboard Box" where the stats will be stored as to who is playing and their score in real time (hopefully)
## Sixth Commit  (Finally Making Progress) 

Added in code so that once begin is hit on the live server, the first question will appear. Still need to make it so that once answered, system will give you points and or deduct time, as well as move onto the next questions.

## Seventh Commit

I have created the function "displayQuestion" and defined what that means, as well as checkAnswer which SHOULD determine if the answer
is correct or incorrect
